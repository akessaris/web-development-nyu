                As you can see from my mugshot from my last "Escape Room" (from which I escaped with 10 seconds to spare), I'm a well-mannered, cultural, and sophisticated intellectual. Also, contrary to the mugshot, I've  never been convicted of a single crime (except that one time I pushed a kid in high school, almost started a small-scale riot, and had to clean the classroom after school as punishment).

                Admittedly, I'm not a very extravagant man. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, staying physically active and mentally engaged, eating homecooked meals, and the refreshing taste of a cold beer on the beach. But with your help, I can cast aside these frivolous expenditures and do something more meaningful with my newfound wealth!
